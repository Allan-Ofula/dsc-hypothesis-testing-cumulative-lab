From the histogram, the overall shape of the PHYSHLTH distributions across the three states appears similar, with most respondents reporting few or no unhealthy days. However, there are slight variations in the frequencies of higher values, suggesting potential differences in mean values.

Interpretation of ANOVA Results

**Calculated p-value:**  
The p-value (**8.80 × 10⁻⁹**) is much lower than **0.05**, so we **reject the null hypothesis**.  

 **Conclusion:**  
There is a **significant difference** in the average number of unhealthy days (PHYSHLTH) among the three states. This suggests that factors like **healthcare access, socioeconomic conditions, or public health policies** may vary by state.  

 **Recommendations:**  
1. **Identify Key Differences** – Conduct further analysis to pinpoint which states differ most.  
2. **Targeted Interventions** – States with higher unhealthy days should implement health initiatives.  
3. **Address Root Causes** – Investigate factors like income, healthcare access, and environment.  
4. **Allocate Resources** – Direct public health efforts where they are needed most.  

State-specific policies could help reduce disparities in physical health outcomes.
